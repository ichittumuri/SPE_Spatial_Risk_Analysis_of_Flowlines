# Abstract

Flowlines, subsurface pipelines that transport oil, gas, and produced water, are critical yet understudied components of petroleum infrastructure. Building on prior work, this study modeled and predicted the risk probability of flowline spills within Colorado by improving spill-to-flowline attribution, expanding geospatial covariates, and incorporating spatial statistical methods. A refined spill-matching algorithm increased usable spill records from 41 to 474, and flowline geometries were segmented into regularly spaced points for point-level modeling. As a proof of concept, initial analyses focused on the Boulder–Greeley region. Logistic regression with LASSO identified key predictors of failure, and a spatial autocorrelation test on residuals revealed significant clustering, motivating a spatial modeling framework. A thin plate spline (TPS) logistic smoother, estimated via Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares, was implemented, and three configurations were compared: a non-spatial logistic regression, a spatial-only TPS model, and a spatial covariates–integrated TPS model. This approach supported data-driven decision-making in flowline infrastructure monitoring and environmental protection. Future extensions include using tile-based strategies to model all flowlines across Colorado, continuous risk profiling of the entire flowline network, and refining risk estimates based on proximity to densely populated areas. 

The full publication will be soon available.
